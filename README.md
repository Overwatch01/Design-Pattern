# Design-Pattern
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

# What does the pattern consist of?
Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
Code example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
